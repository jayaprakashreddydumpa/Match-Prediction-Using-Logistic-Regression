# Match-Prediction-Using-Logistic-Regression
Predicts Premiere League matches using Logistic Regression Model
This project focuses on building a prediction model based on Logistic Regression which uses Newton-Raphson optimization algorithm to predict match results of Premiere League season 2017/18. The variables used in this paper are not considered based on wild guesses, but rather considered based on previous work done in similar field. Data used for this project was obtained from multiple websites. The preprocessing steps involved are converting the data to csv format and then extracting the required stats such as “Win Percentage”, “Scoring Probability” and “Save Probability”. These stats were calculated based on the whether the team was performing at “Home” or “Away”. Logistic Regression along with the regression coefficients gives better prediction results which were calculated by training the model over the past 8 years data. The accuracy of prediction is 71% on the test data.
